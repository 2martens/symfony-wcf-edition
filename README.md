Symfony-WCF
===========

This is the merge of the Woltlab Community Framework and the Symfony framework. 
The goal is to unite the advantages of both and leave out the disadvantages of the WCF.

This document lists the bundles that are added to the Symfony framework to add the 
WCF functionality if it isn't already provided by Symfony and gives information about
how to download, install and start using Symfony-WCF.
